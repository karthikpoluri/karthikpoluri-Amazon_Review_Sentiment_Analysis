I was so in the moment with Broken World and hurt with Mia because she was surrounded by people but so alone and I understood her feelings.  I found myself wishing I could give her some of my courage and strength or even just to be there for her.

       "\"An eBook was provided via NetGalley for an honest review. YA with a bit of the paranormal, this book is suitable for anyone 12+ and above.Every year, I get a flu shot. Every year. So far, it has not affected me adversely. In fact, it has helped cut down the number of days and alleviate the intensity of the flu symptoms when I do get it.Twenty two teenagers from the Bloomberg High School thought the same thing.  Nothing would happen, right? They were wrong. They were prepared for possible headaches, sore arms, possible slight fever. They were not prepared to hear everyone - telepathically. So now they know everyone's secret, what everyone was thinking. That would be perfect, right?Don't Even Think About It is funny, sarcastic, revealing, poignant and engrossing. Be prepared to get immersed in teenage insecurities, angst, crushes, young love and betrayal.Forced to band together to deal with their new sensitivity, personalities who would normally not band together suddenly find themselves as part of a tight knit group. Preconceived notions and biases are slowly broken down as the group find themselves working together for support and understanding.  Sarah Mlynowski cleverly develops different plot points as she explores how this new talent influences relationships and decisions. Do you know that saying ... about being careful what you wish for? Well, these high school teenagers find out the hard way what it truly means.Life as they know has undeniably changed for the Bloomberg 22, and they will eventually be called to make a decision about their future. What will they do?Don't Even Think About It is a quick read. I found the story engaging and entertaining that I finished reading the book in two days.  It is suitable for preteens and young adults. The book was well edited, skillfully told by the author. If you are looking for a quick light read, pick up this book. You won't regret it.\""

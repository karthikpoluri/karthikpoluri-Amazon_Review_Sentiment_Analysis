# karthikpoluri-Amazon_Review_Sentiment_Analysis
I have conducted a sentiment analysis on the amazon product reviews, This will help us classify and detect the sentiment behind the reviews of customers.
In this project i have used 10000 Amazon product reviews dataset from kaggle.
I have followed the following steps in order to solve this problem... 
1. Reading the in Java Script object form and converting it into normal text formate.
2. Used the NLP techniques such as counting and vectorizing the words and used NLTK lingustics for this.
3. performed the cosine similarity based comparison between content.
4. Used SVM and whole host of other models among which SVM (Support Vector Machine ) Performed well.
Now i got the problem that the dataset is incredibly skewed so had to solve the imbalanced dataset problem.
Now the model is performing well and did some hyper parameter tuning which made the model even more efficient.
